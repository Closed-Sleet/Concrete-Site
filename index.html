      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p> An analysis of the information currently known about the concrete plains. </p>
    
    <!-- intro Info dump -->
      <h2>Snow Sleet Corporation</h2>

      <p>The company "Snow Sleet" is an unrecognized organization claiming to be from the astral plains. This "company" recently aired advertisements about a supposed "tour" of these "astral plains" This tour was not paid for with money, but silver. This sparked the interest of local law enforcement officers and quick attempts were made to determine the source of the advertisement. The only lead was a now defunct phone number. When dialed the offer from the ad was stated and a drop box for the payment to be placed in. The location would change based on where the caller is and was always within walking distance of the caller. The price was 50 kg of pure silver. Those who paid were never heard from again and records of their existence have been seemingly wiped. Almost immediately after the first round of reports the attention of every major world power was drawn to these advertisements and global panic was quickly quelled by the suppresion of evidance and refusal to publically awknowledge any valid evidance towards the advertisements. </p>

      <h2>Government Interest</h2>

      <p> The FCC was the first Government organization to be alerted to the company. There were thousands of complaints filed by people about the "aggressive" and "intrusive" nature of the advertisements. The FCC then sent information off to the FBI which then created a dedicated task force to research the subject due to the company's claims and the lack of information from other sources. </p> 

      <p> The biggest reason why the Government got concerned so quickly was due to the nature of the advertisements. Reportedly the advertisements were forced to play on devices even without internet connectivity or batteries. The advertisements were super personalized, with some accounts of the voices of deceased loved one's being used. The true nature is not yet understood however there is wide spread belief that this is of eldrich origin.</p>
