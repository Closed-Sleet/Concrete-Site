    <h2>Snow Sleet Corporation</h2>
    <p>The company "Snow Sleet" is an unrecognised organisation claiming to be from the astral plains. This company recently spread advertisements about a supposed "tour" of these plains. This tour was not paid for with money but silver. This sparked the interest of law enforcement and quickly attempts were made to determine the source of the advertisement. The only lead was a now defunct phone number. When dialed the offer from the AD was stated and a drop box for the paymentto be placed in. The location would change based on where the caller is and was always within walking distance of the caller. The price was 50kg of pure silver. Those who paid the price were never heard from again and records of their existance were gone. This immidiately got the attention of ever major world power but most quickly dismissed it due to the rather strange lack of hard evidence.</p>
    <h2>Government Interest</h2>
    <p> The FCC was the first Government organisation to be alerted to the company. There were 1,000's of complaints filed by people about the "agressive" and "intrusive" nature of the advertisements. The FCC then sent information off to the FBI which then created a dedicated task force to reserch the subject due to the company's claims. </p>
