    <h1> Something's wrong </h1>
    <p> The tour group hasn't returned yet and the Governments somehow are gathering information on us. If you have any ideas/information please contact <a href="mailto:deltasleet@gmail.com">Delta</a>.</p>

    <h1>Information</h1>
    <h2>The last ping sent by the tour contained the following document:</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the astral plains. Thank you for choosing SSC. As your tour guides we have to warn you that the astral plains are very dangerous for mortals especially. Due to this fact the tour will exclusively feature the Concrete plains. For those with the Full Tour Pass, you have opted to visit the City of Yggdrasil in addition to the Concrete Plains.</p>

    <p>If something is to go wrong during the tour follow your tour guide and stay calm. Remember out here you are less than ants to most of these beings, please avoid speaking to or interacting with any non-human entities. This is for the safety of the group, not just you. Your tour guide is one of the owners of SSC, Bravo is his name.</p>

    <p>Alright mortals, you all paid an excessive sum of silver to risk your lives and sanity just for a glimpse into what lays beyond. Please listen to me at all times, this is a very dangerous place. If you ever feel like you are in danger, that is the proper reaction. If you don’t comply I’ll kill you myself if needed. You all have been warned excessively at this point so it's time to start the tour.</p>

    <p>Firstly we will be starting at Plain Alpha-000001, the first plain closest to our exit point from Yggdrasil. Those aren’t windows, they are just displays so rest assured anything outside, in fact, cannot see you. This plain is primarily housing the militaristic force of Concrete. We are just below the City of Yggdrasil and will be separating into multiple vehicles at the end of the tour.</p>

    <p>The displays each of you see in front of you are camera systems, please use them to cycle to whatever camera you wish to use. If you’d like there are implants that we can install that will allow your entire vision to be the camera... No takers? Your loss. Alright if you switch to camera 1b you will see thousands of Concrete's robots all marching in place. This is done to throw off any attempts to spy on this plain and also to prevent unauthorized travel to and from this plain. Obviously this is ineffective to beings of Chaos such as myself and is the reason we are able to be here today. Those of you looking out the other cameras may realize that the space outside seems to be contorted and non-euclidian. We assure you this is not the case. This is the result of distortion, created by yours truly, to keep us concealed.</p>

    <p>The astral plains are a place outside of Yggdrasil, Yggdrasil was dubbed as the world tree by those in these plains and it represents the multiverse as you all know it. The structure is very much based on ideas and beliefs. Any story ever conceived does truly happen somewhere within the multiverse. These branches upon branches may seem a bit much for one tree. But don't be fooled. There are other world trees, all but a few of which are connected to Yggdrasil via their roots. Before I explain further, any questions?</p>

    <p>What about mistakes in writing, what happens to affected realities?</p>

    <p>Well, generally stories don't cover everything so consolidations of the story tend to mimic reality. Generally though, some situations tend to just describe other realities as opposed to the same reality within one story/narrative. Ideally all of them would be consolidated down to one proper narrative and story, but Yggdrasil seems to have decided against that.</p>

    <p> Decided?</p>
