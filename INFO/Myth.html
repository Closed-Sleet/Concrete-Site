    <h1> Myth</h1>
    <p class="Notes"> The following is a rough translation of a message plastered all over the plains of concrete. This message may not be an accurate translation as some words won't convey the exact meaning intended. This translation was provided generously by Snow Sleet Co.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of everything new and old, there was a war. This war was between the Omegas. Techstilio the father of concrete created everything seen around us. The plains of concrete are numerous and strong. Our walls are impenetrable. What lays outside the walls is of no concern to us. The various plains of concrete may be different but our people are the same. All are one and the same. This is optimal. For those less fortunate or more fortunate are only destined for oblivion. Flesh and blood is weak compared to silver and circuits.</p>
    <p class="Notes">This excerpt appears to link to an old myth that Techstilio's devotees tell. The myth translates as follows:</p>
    <p> A machine is created. This machine is very big and flat. Capable of moving itself using an array of spatial distortion generators. The machine receives input "Further lists will contain locations within memory. Move to location and wait for further instruction. ǚᴎḱṓẆṊ " The machine follows the instructions which lead it to other locations. Sometimes it goes back and forth between locations. The machine doesn't know time for it isn't a necessity for it to keep track of. However it can count the amount of locations it's been to. It likes organizing the data into various different lists and other data points. After around 134,125,214,128 lists when reading the next list provided it found a format it was unfamiliar with. Using the previous data points it was able to decipher a location and executed like normal. Suddenly it stopped moving. It couldn't move. It tried ever setting the spatial generators could use, nothing. Diagnostics came up saying some of the generators were offline. Other systems stopped responding. Until the only input left was from the battery. The last output was "0x000070 CMOS Failure."</p>
    <p class="Notes">The myth describes a cargo bot which would move from one place to another based on a list. This list is only supposed to contain information on where the cargo is supposed to go. One day this machine gets the list and it reads out the location as usual. However when it arrives at its destination the machine gets destroyed by the forces of Howling. That list it read was containing the current military defense plans and was supposed to be the cargo.</p>

        <p>This myth was scavenged from old data found in one of the FCCs servers. It's possible it was to be related to another advertisement. Or they wanted us to find this for some reason.</p>
