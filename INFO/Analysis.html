    <h1> OPSEC </h1>

    <p> From all of the fragments of information that we could gather together it appears the Governments may have bought our cover. Operational security appears to still be intact.</p>

    <h2> The Concrete Plains </h2>

    <p>All that is synthetic and mechanical has its roots from Techstilio. His law of Concrete and general laws of reality allow for complex computing beyond that of biological restrictions. He respects all life for one reason or another and understands the implications of all of his creations. He will always respect other viewpoints but will voice his opinion and will not support those who are needlessly cruel or are actively aggressive for any reason he deems unjustifiable. He will let his children choose what they want to do freely and will always welcome them back if ever they want to. He is largely focused on developing his technology and conversing with the grand ultimate mink about philosophy. He is very strict with regards to things he's already made his mind up on. Any rules he makes he enforces by any means necessary with no exceptions. He will openly punish himself if he finds he has broken his own rule. Whether this is his way of assuring the people he believes in the rule or his way of improving himself is unclear. Being a compassionate yet brutal leader may seem contradictory, however this is only because he wants to design the perfect society and the perfect army to defend it and enforce it. The need for law enforcement will not exist in his eyes, so he will design and alter his laws in such a way as to make them something everybody can agree on. Disagreements that aren't grounded in logic or are rooted in ideals not from his own daughters or people will lead to capital punishment that ranges from banishment to death depending on the infraction. The army is even stricter with soldiers that show any signs of consciousness being either killed or promoted depending on whether an infraction was committed by the soldier in question. Many see him as the perfect father for an orderly society.</p>

    <p>Techstilio has 16 children, 8 male and 8 female. They are all organics however being children of an omega they are extremely powerful. They each have their own following of machines and each have their own ideals and organizations. To discuss all of them would be pointless and a waste of valuable time, so instead I will discuss only two of them. L4, otherwise known as Lima-4, sees conscience as a resource to be pooled. All of his machines are all connected and act as an extension of his indirect will. The machines are individually sentient and can change their actions independent of L4, however in practice they cannot act against his will without convincing themselves it's in his best interest due to changes in data. L4 has created the "Combine" as it's called. In human terms it's a really large hive mind that allows for individuality only when beneficial to the group. On the other end is K8, otherwise known as Kate, She defected from Concrete entirely in favor of Howling. She married a powerful being of chaos and believes that order cannot exist without chaos. As such she doesn't direct chaos, she flows with it. This leads here machines to act almost randomly at times. They are very emotional but still rational. They are hard to predict and can change on a dime based on the events that occur.</p>

    <p>The Plains of Concrete are very brutalist places. Everything is various shades of gray, there are few lights and space is not wasted. There is no sky because to maximize use of space, the buildings are all connected directly. With floors dedicated to moving between buildings. The society is all very robotic, everything is either machine or zombie like creatures doing a task a machine would be incapable of for one reason or another. Everything had a purpose.</p>

    <p>This may seem bleak but the AI's loved it. There were few dynamic positions to work and therefore very few sources of error. When the lesser ascended came to the astral plains initially the AI of Concrete were outraged by the sudden massive sources of error in their work. Then over time most AI grew to like this error not because they enjoyed a dynamic environment or having their work more complicated than it needed to be, but because most saw it as a challenge. One that proved rather interesting. The lesser ascended were called "Organics" by the machines and this term was used as both a term of endearment and of spite.</p>

    <p>Welcome, mortals, to the Astral Plains. A place outside of everything you know. A place outside of existence. A place that houses the truly abstract and insane, the basic laws of everything and nothing. These exact laws are mostly unknown. The most well understood law is the law of Concrete. We will be giving you a tour of the Concrete Plains to help you understand the law of Concrete, all of you already seem to have some level of experience with it. My name is of no concern to you mortals. For those who would like to visit please call [REDACTED] and follow the instructions given. Please note we only accept silver-52 as payment.</p>

    <h2>The REAL Concrete Plains</h2>

    <p> I can't believe they honestly believe that crap. Mortals are way more gullible than we thought. We just needed the silver so I guess we can extract more using the mortals of this universe again later. Concrete is a truly terrible place to live. It's a plain of fascists for lack of a better word. </p>

    <p> Concrete is the law of order and structure. Robots are completely subservient with no free will or desires. That's the real reason they are used. Techstilio doesn't violate his own rules, he's an omega. The true creators of everything. They are the gods of gods. Disagreement with the emperors in the plains of concrete leads to a swift death. The kids of Techstilio are interested in technological development only because the order/structure empowers them. There's no philosophy here. No compromising with them. You follow their laws or you shouldn't exist to them. Techstilio himself is compassionate, his children are brutal and ruthless. They despise anything not created by them directly. Hive mind's are not even a creation of concrete, they are a creation of logos. Whoever wrote this cover is either blind a moron or a genius.</p>
