    <h1> The Advertisement</h1>
    <p> The advertisement was part of the lost data. While it is remembered by those who saw it or heard it, there is no digital or physcial trace of the advertisement itself. Though there is proof the advertisement was playing on certain television channels with references to commercial time bought by Snow Sleet, the actual recordings are just blank. The means of which this happened are unkown however it is implied that there was some sort of hyjacking that could've led to the deletion of the advertisements. </p>
  
    <h2>Witness Accounts</h2>
        <p> The witnesses in question don't seem to have a reliable memory. They each had different recollections of the advertisement, though each of them were able to consistently describe their own story for the advertisement and were very adamant on the details. </p>
        <p> Most of the witnesses described what seemed to be personalized advertisements, and all of the witnesses that have come forward so far have had silver in their possesion. Weather or not any of this is true these witness accounts cannot be confirmed nor denied. </p>
