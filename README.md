# Plains of Concrete
This is a website I am developing for fun and for senior english class.
I hope to return to javascript stuff with this but I have a very tight deadline for the assignment.
I have a little under a week to get everything written and put into the website and making it look good.
This is going to be tough but fun.

If you have any advice feel free to give it and raise any issues you'd like.
